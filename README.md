# Meow a Wish
This is an SAO I designed to share at Hackaday Supercon 2025.

This SAO is an interesting combination of an analog circuits and linoleum block printing! This repository contains the PCB and 3D models, but I can't upload a linoleum block to GitHub so you'll have to come up with your own.

At some point I'll have a full write-up about it here: [nanik.ca/projects](https://www.nanik.ca/projects/)

What is an SAO? Here's a Hackaday article about that: [https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/)
